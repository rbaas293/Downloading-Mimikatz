# Downloading-Mimikatz
How to get Mimikatz on windows 10 without defender quarantining it.

## Fake Out Windows Defender

**Create a folder named `WD-Bypass` in a directory of your choosing, I picked my `Downloads` Folder.**

1. Search in Windows start menu for `Virus & threat protection` and go to it
2. Go to `Virus & threat protection settings` 
3. Scroll Down to `Exclusions` and click `Add or remove exclusions`
4. Click `+ Add an exclusion`
5. Click `Folder`
6. Choose the `WD-Bypass` folder in the directory that you chose

**NOTE:** Anything you download in this folder will **NOT** be detected by Windows Defender, so be careful in the future.
